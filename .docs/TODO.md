## Todo (will be implemented at user specified request)

### Dependency Management

- [ ] **Outdated Packages:** Several npm packages are outdated. Updating them can provide access to new features, security patches, and performance enhancements. Key packages to update include:
  - `@supabase/supabase-js`
  - `@sveltejs/kit`
  - `vite`
  - `nodemailer`
  - `leaflet`
- [x] **Legacy Packages:** `qr.js` appears to be an old and potentially unmaintained package. It would be best to replace it with a more modern and actively maintained alternative for generating QR codes.

### SEO and Accessibility

- [x] **Meta Tags & Structured Data:** As outlined in `improvements.md`, adding dynamic meta titles, descriptions, and implementing structured data (Schema.org) for properties would significantly improve SEO.
- [x] **Sitemap:** Generating a `sitemap.xml` file will help search engines better crawl and index the site.
- [x] **Image Optimization:** Compressing images and ensuring all images have descriptive `alt` text will improve both performance and accessibility.
- [ ] **Accessibility Audit:** Performing an accessibility audit using tools like Lighthouse or axe would help identify and fix issues related to color contrast, keyboard navigation, and more.

### User Experience

- [ ] **Performance:** Optimizing images and ensuring efficient code-splitting will lead to faster page load times and a better user experience.
