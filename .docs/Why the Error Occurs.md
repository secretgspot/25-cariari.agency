### Why the Error Occurs

The error `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: $.get(...).markerClusterGroup is not a function` typically happens when the `markerClusterGroup` function is not available on the object you're calling it on. This is a common issue when integrating Leaflet and its MarkerCluster plugin in frameworks like Svelte. The root causes are usually:

- The Leaflet MarkerCluster plugin is not properly imported or loaded.
- The plugin is loaded before Leaflet itself, or not at all.
- You're trying to call `markerClusterGroup` on an object that doesn't have the function (e.g., a jQuery object or an incomplete Leaflet instance).


### How to Fix the Issue

#### 1. Ensure Proper Imports

For Svelte (or any modern JavaScript setup), make sure you import both Leaflet and the MarkerCluster plugin correctly:

```js
import * as L from 'leaflet';
import 'leaflet.markercluster';
```

After these imports, the function should be available as `L.markerClusterGroup()`[^1].

#### 2. Correct Usage Example

Here's how you should create a MarkerClusterGroup:

```js
const markers = L.markerClusterGroup();
markers.addLayer(L.marker([lat, lng]));
map.addLayer(markers);
```

Do not call `markerClusterGroup` on the result of `$.get()` or any jQuery object. Use it only on the Leaflet namespace (`L`).

#### 3. Check Load Order

Ensure that the MarkerCluster plugin is loaded after Leaflet. If you are using script tags, the order matters:

```html
<script src="leaflet.js"></script>
<script src="leaflet.markercluster.js"></script>
```

If using npm modules, import Leaflet first, then MarkerCluster[^1][^2].

#### 4. Svelte-Specific Notes

- If you are dynamically importing the plugin, assign it to a variable and use the class directly:

```js
const markercluster = await import('leaflet.markercluster');
const markerClusterGroup = new markercluster.MarkerClusterGroup();
```

- Make sure all imports and plugin initializations happen on the client side, not during SSR (Server-Side Rendering), as Leaflet depends on the DOM[^2].


### Common Pitfalls

- **Missing CSS:** The MarkerCluster plugin also requires its CSS files for proper display.
- **Incorrect Object:** Do not use jQuery objects with Leaflet methods.
- **SSR Issues:** Always guard Leaflet and plugin code to only run in the browser.


### Summary Table

| Issue | Solution |
| :-- | :-- |
| `markerClusterGroup` not a function | Import both Leaflet and MarkerCluster plugin |
| Plugin loaded before Leaflet | Load/import Leaflet first, then MarkerCluster |
| Called on wrong object | Use `L.markerClusterGroup()`, not on jQuery objects |
| SSR/DOM not available | Run code only in browser context |

If you follow these steps, the error should be resolved and clustering should work as expected in your Svelte application.
